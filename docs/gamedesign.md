General Description:
"Neon Miner" - a modern take on the classic Minesweeper with unique multi-choice mechanics. Players navigate through a neon-lit grid, strategically revealing multiple cells per turn while competing against time and random challenges. The futuristic design and progressive difficulty create an engaging experience across all devices.

Game Design:

1. Core Mechanics:
   - Grid Layout: Dynamic, aspect-ratio maintained grid with neon borders
   - Turn System: 
     * Player selects 2-4 fields (based on difficulty)
     * System reveals one random unopened field
     * First click always safe, revealing neighboring numbers
   - Field States: 
     * Unopened (default)
     * Marked (player-flagged as bomb)
     * Revealed (showing number or empty)
     * Exploded (game over state)

2. Difficulty Levels:
   ```javascript
   const defaultDifficulties = {
     easy: {
       gridSize: { width: 8, height: 8 },
       bombs: 10,
       movesPerTurn: 2
     },
     medium: {
       gridSize: { width: 12, height: 12 },
       bombs: 24,
       movesPerTurn: 3
     },
     hard: {
       gridSize: { width: 16, height: 16 },
       bombs: 40,
       movesPerTurn: 4
     }
   }
   ```

3. UI Components:
   - Header Section:
     * Game title
     * Current difficulty
     * Timer display
     * Moves counter
   - Game Grid:
     * Responsive cells with neon glow
     * Hover effects with light intensity change
     * Number colors following neon theme
   - Control Panel:
     * New Game button
     * Difficulty selector
     * Toggle flag mode
   - Statistics Panel:
     * High scores table
     * Win rate
     * Average completion time

4. Animations:
   - Cell Reveal:
     * Neon pulse effect
     * Number fade-in
   - Explosion:
     * Radial shockwave
     * Color burst
   - Random Cell Selection:
     * Scanning effect
     * Selection highlight

5. Save System:
   - Local Storage:
     * Current game state
     * High scores
     * User preferences
   - Statistics:
     * Games played
     * Win rate
     * Best times per difficulty

6. Progressive Features:
   - Sound effects with toggle
   - Haptic feedback for mobile
   - Achievement system
   - Daily challenges

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or proceed with the technical architecture design?

The next step would be breaking this down into implementable modules and creating a basic proof of concept. I can suggest starting with either:
1. Core game logic implementation
2. Basic UI layout and responsiveness
3. State management setup

Which aspect would you prefer to focus on first?
